A Haskell SMTP Server

OVERVIEW

This code implements a simple server for receiving SMTP transmissions
from RFC821 compliant SMTP clients.  It listens on a specified port
for connections and then spawns transaction threads for each incoming
request.  Each request is handled according to the basic requirements
laid out in RFC821.  If a valid e-mail message is received, it is save
in an output file (msgs.txt).  All transactions, successful and
unsuccessful, are logged (log.txt).

COMPILING

For optimal performance, the server should be compiled with GHC using
the following command:

ghc --make Main.hs -o smtp_sever

where smtp_server is the desired name of the executable.  Code
developed and tested using GHC 6.6.

CUSTOMIZING

The file Main.hs contains a variable for setting the port to listen on
for incoming connections.  Low numbered ports may require root
privileges, so choose carefully. 

The file Reply.hs contains several variables at the top of the file
which determine which e-mail addresses are accepted by the server.
The server is designed only to accept email for its domain and for
users it recognizes, since it cannot currently relay messages.

COMING SOON

This implementation, while functional, has room for expansion.  The
next version should be able to relay messages to other SMTP servers.
Future version should include a configuration file and upgrade
compliance to RFC2821.
